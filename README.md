# SOEN6841 - Software Project Management

Welcome to my repository for the **SOEN6841 - Software Project Management** course at Concordia University, taught by **Prof. Joumana Dargham**. This repository serves as a collection of my work throughout the course, including learning journals, assignments, and projects.

## Contents

- **Learning Journals**  
  Weekly reflections and insights from course materials, discussions, and personal research. These journals provide a record of my progress and understanding of key topics such as:
  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
  - Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems
  - Project management methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall)
  - Software development lifecycle management
  
  **Learning journals will be updated weekly.**

- **Assignments and Projects**  
  Hands-on projects and assignments related to the course content, applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

## Learning Journal Updates

Each week, I will add a new journal entry reflecting on the topics covered in the lectures, readings, and discussions. These updates aim to track my learning journey and demonstrate my growing understanding of software project management principles.
